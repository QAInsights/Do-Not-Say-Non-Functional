# Do Not Say Non-Functional in QA

Merriam Dictionary's definition of `non-functional`: 
> having no function : serving or performing no useful purpose

# Rationale

QA professionals, especially those working in `Performance Engineering and Testing` negates the term `Non-Functional`. The rationale behind is: the term `performance` is `functional` for any application. Similarly for [`Accessbility Testing`](https://web.dev/accessible/), [`Security Testing`](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), and more.

AFAIK, there is no official term for `Non-Functional Testing` or `Non-Functional Requirements`. Industry leaders James Bach, Cem Kaner, Alexander Podelko and more agrees that the term misrepresents the testing objective.
